# Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project
Just learned DOM manipulation and I am doing [this](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) exercise for practice.\
The scariest part is CSS. With a little googling and a quick prompt to GPT about grid, I managed to do the CSS. JavaScript is easier than I thought.\
Check out the page I deployed to [Github Pages](https://ardnys.github.io/OdinSketch/).
